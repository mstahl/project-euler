-- Let D_0 be the two-letter string "Fa". For n â‰¥ 1, derive D_n from D_(n-1) by the
-- string-rewriting rules:
-- 
-- "a" -> "aRbFR" 
-- "b" -> "LFaLb"
-- 
-- Thus, D_0 = "Fa", D_1 = "FaRbFR", D_2 = "FaRbFRRLFaLbFR", and so on.
-- 
-- These strings can be interpreted as instructions to a computer graphics
-- program, with "F" meaning "draw forward one unit", "L" meaning "turn left 90
-- degrees", "R" meaning "turn right 90 degrees", and "a" and "b" being
-- ignored. The initial position of the computer cursor is (0,0), pointing up
-- towards (0,1).
-- 
-- Then D_n is an exotic drawing known as the Heighway Dragon of order n. For
-- example, D_10 is shown below; counting each "F" as one step, the highlighted
-- spot at (18,16) is the position reached after 500 steps.
-- 
-- What is the position of the cursor after 10^12 steps in D_50?
-- 
-- Give your answer in the form x,y with no spaces.
