-- There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n,
-- such that the expression n^(3) + n^(2)p is a perfect cube.
-- 
-- For example, when p = 19, 8^(3) + 8^(2)Ã—19 = 12^(3).
-- 
-- What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the
-- value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.
-- 
-- How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?
